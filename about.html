Hello, I am "Bikash Jaiswal". I am working as Research Assistant at Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.tezu.ernet.in/dcompsc/), [Tezpur University](http://www.tezu.ernet.in). Currently, My works are focused for Center of Excellence project entitled **Machine Learing Research and Big Data Analytics** underwritten by Ministry of Human, Resource and Development (MHRD), Government of India.

During my Undergraduate, I have worked on Bioinformatics, concentrating on Breast-cancer microarrays  datasets. A parallel method for module extraction was proposed and implemented by harnessing the power of GPU on heyday of B-tech program. The method was able to predict 5 unprecedented genes as causal genes for Breast-cancer.

This blog is resemblance of some chuck of my research and peculiar stuff that entice as well as confound me on daily to daily basis.
