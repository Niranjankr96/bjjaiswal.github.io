Hello, I am "Bikash Jaiswal". I am working as Technical Assistant at Department of
<a href="http://www.tezu.ernet.in/dcompsc/">Computer Science and Engineering</a>,
<a href="http://www.tezu.ernet.in">Tezpur University</a>.

I look forward to building technological solution for health care buttressed by artificial intelligence. I am primarily interested in working on Machine Learning and Big-Data technology for solving large scale technical challenges. I also have keen on developing software for HPC especially parallel computing.

Aside from computer science, I love writing poems, like to travel and exploring new adventure that life can offer.

Thanks for stopping by, hope you like it here. Please feel free to get in touch !

###  What is the meaning of life?
>The meaning of life is not about how to have life, but how to live by yourself. If you are willing to bury this six-footed body on a white dream, that is the meaning of your life. If you anger and cheer up, and you are determined to seek the meaning of life and create your own meaning of life, then you will have a day's meaning when you live, and you will add meaning to one thing, life is endless, and the meaning of life is endless â€“ Hu Shi
