Welcome, I am "Bikash Jaiswal" and I am currently working as Research Assistant on project entitled **"Machine Learing Research and Big Data Analytics"** under Professor Dr. Nityananda Sarma at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tezpur University. In this blog, I write down some interesting stuff and observation that I learn on my contemporary research.
