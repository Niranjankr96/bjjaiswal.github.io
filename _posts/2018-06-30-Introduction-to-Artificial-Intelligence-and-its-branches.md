Today, we can no more state that we are living in __Information Technology__ era. We have come far beyond the IT. We are living in __Artificial Intelligence__ age. AI is affecting diverse industries ranging from __healthcare to an automobile__, __video games to military__, __finance and economics to audit__, and many more.

 > "Artificial intelligence": When a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving" - Russell & Norvig, 2009

We all are familiar with word Artificial Intelligence form movies like "The Terminator", "The Matrix", "A Space Odyssey", etc and best classic novels like "Frankenstein", "The Hitchhiker guide to the Galaxy", and many more. But it's an arduous task to explain Artificial Intelligence to novice and distinguish it for its branches like __Machine Learning__ and __Deep Learning__, __Reinforcement learning__. In this post, I will try to explain in a laconic way despite being cogent: How AI, Machine Learning and Deep learning are different from each other nevertheless, shelter under the same umbrella.


During 1900s, when researcher discovered that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning a.k.a Church–Turing thesis- an idea was embroiled among the researchers. The idea to accumulate understanding from __Neurobiology__, __Information Theory__, __Cybernetics__ and many other branches for Natural science and engineering to build a __electronic brain__ or __artificial brain__. Then the perennial movement of Artificial Intelligence begun.

For simple games such as tic-tac-toe, it is possible to represent all possible game states (the complete game tree) visually

Earlier AI system were built on a list of formal, logistic and mathematical rules. Some such rules were Informed/Uninformed search strategies, Propositional Logic, First Order Logic, Planning, Heuristics functions, etc,. We feted IBM's Deep chess-playing system when it defeated world champion Garry Kasparov. But the system was completely rules and logic based system. A system for defeating games like chess, tic-tac-toe, AlphaGO, etc can be built by programmer ahead of competition from a list of complete formal rules and logics. This is known as __Knowledge based Intelligent System__.
