 "artificial intelligence" -> when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with
 other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving" - Russell & Norvig, 2009

We all are familiar with word `Artificial Intelligence` form movies like "The Terminator","The Matrix", "A Space Odyssey", etc, and best classic novels like "Frankenstein", "The Hitchhiker guide to the Galaxy", and many more. But it's an arduous task to explain Artificial Intelligence to novice and distinguish it for its branches like `Machine Learning` and `Deep Learning`. In this post, I will try to explain in a laconic way despite being cogent: How AI, Machine Learning and Deep learning are different from each other nevertheless, shelter under the same umbrella.

### History
During 1900s, when researcher discovered that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning a.k.a Churchâ€“Turing thesis- an idea was embroiled among the researchers. The idea to accumulate understanding from `Neurobiology`,`Information Theory`, `Cybernetics` and many other branches for Natural science and engineering to build a `electronic brain` or `artificial brain`.
