## Unix philosophy
One word that can subsume the word "Unix" for this Information era - could be the word "simplicity". The main motivation for implementing Unix ([Unics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FjX7r5icV8)) was to make less sophisticated operating system and to incorporate following ideas.

>Driving idea of Unix

*  Portable: OS up to this point were wedded to the computer used

*  Mutli-tasking, multi-user
*  Simple and light-weight OS (Kernel)
*  Use of flat plain text-files
*  Hierarchical file system
*  Large number of software tools
